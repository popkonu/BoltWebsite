        Welcome, this website site will teach you everything you need to know about coding with Bolt from <a href="https://unity.com/">Unity</a>. 
        Bolt is a visual scripting program recentlly added to all packages from unity, including the free one. 
        The reason that this site is all about bolt and not another visual scripting program is because Bolt is 
        most like actually scripting with C# and most easy to convert any C# script into a visual script. In 
        Bolt 2.0 you will be able to convert your visual scripts to C# scripts. The reason this is good is because 
        Visual programmers will be able to communicate with C# scripters without teaching eachother how to use the program they are using.

      <h2>Reasons Bolt is so Good</h2>
      <ul class="centerAlign">
      <li>Its more recent and is more popular than most visual scripting programs for unity.</li>
      <li>Semi easy to use, just keep in mind it is still technically in development.</li>
      <li>Communication is easy with the way the nodes CAN be named.</li>
      </ul>

        Now Bolt isn't perfect like everything, and most of the topics Im about to touch are mainly my opinion or popular opinion so take it with a grain of salt.
        One thing that really makes bolt only semi easy to use is one specific glitch. When you open up the window to create a node, in most versions there is no way to close that window unless you place a node.
        This gets really annoying at times and makes it hard to work in the program. A second problem is that there aren't many tutorials out there about bolt since its a fairly new program.
        My last problem with it is most people don't want to use it proffesonally at the moment and think it's just a thing for kids, but really visual scripting is really good sometimes because some people like me have problems learning coding. 
        its like learning a new language. literally.

      <ol class="centerAlign">
        <li>Although being more popular than most visual scripting programs its not more popular than normal coding.</li>
        <li>Still technically in beta and breaks alot.</li>
        <li>Is only implimented as an addon and not as a full fledged feature.</li>
